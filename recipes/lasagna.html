        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, 
            flat sheets. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after 
            baking. Typically, cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked 
            in an oven. The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1</strong> clove garlic</li>
            <li><strong>1/2</strong> pound of ground beef</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> cup spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li><strong>6</strong> purchased precooked or oven=ready lasagna noodles (each about 7x3 inches)</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> container (12 ounces) reduced-fat cottage cheese (1 1/2 cups)</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> cup shredded mozzarella cheese (4 ounces)</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Step-by-step</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Cook the beef and 
                garlic in the skillet over medium heat about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, 
                until the beef is brown; drain.
            </li>
            <li>Stir the Italian seasoning and spaghetti sauce into the beef. Spread 1/4 cup of the 
                beef mixture in the ungreased square pan.
            </li>
            <li>Top with 2 noodles, placing them so they do not overlap or touch the sides of the pan 
                because they will expand as they bake. Spread about 1/2 cup of the remaining beef mixture 
                over the noodles.
            </li>
            <li>Spread about 1/2 cup of the cottage cheese over the beef mixture. Sprinkle with about 
                1/3 cup of the mozzarella cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Repeat layering twice more, beginning with 2 more noodles and following directions 
                in steps 3 and 4. Sprinkle with the parmesan cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake 30 minutes. Carefully remove the foil, and continue 
                baking about 10 minutes longer or until lasagna is bubbly around the edges and looks very 
                hot. Let stand 10 minutes, so the lasagna will become easier to cut and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
